# Face Recognition Based Attandance System Using Machine Learning

## Motivation
We seek to provide a valuable attendance service for both teachers and students. Reduce manual process errors by provide automated and a reliable attendance system uses face recognition technology.


## Steps
- Face Detection
- Face Encoding
- Face Recognition
- Marking Attendance 


## Working
When the person stands infornt of working camera live capturing is done.It locates the face in the screen and generate 128 face encodings.
The registered face's are encoded and the model is trained.
These encodings are compared with the registered face encodings.
If there is a match found in the data base then it labels the name of the person on the screen.
If there is no match it labels unknown.
After labeling, the attandance that is the identified person's name, Id and time is visible in the CSV file.
